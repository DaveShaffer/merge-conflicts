# Triple T or ATL-Wood Squares

### User story
>As professional Tic-Tac-Toe players, my wife and I play Tic-Tac-Toe all the time. By day's end, the house is littered with scraps of paper covered with Tic-Tac-Toe grids. We want to play the game on our computer so we can save paper and do our part to prevent global warming.

This game begins with prompts for the users to enter their names for the scoreboard.  Next they are asked if X or O will go first.  Then they begin play by alternately clicking squares on the gameboard.  When one of the players gets three in a row, a pop-up announces the winner and the new score and the scoreboard is updated.  When the players click the OK button on the pop-up, the board is setup for a new game.

### Technologies and Tools
This game was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) and jQuery 2.2.2.  The goals for builing the game were to hone recently gained skills manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript/jQuery, to practice planning and creating an HTML/CSS website and to gain experience with app deployment on GitHub.

### Future Versions
I hope to include background graphics, buttons to let the users select different backgrounds, a start-up sound effect, an animation of the game before play starts with the computer generating random moves, a reset button to restart a game before it is complete, special effects to announce a winner and formatting to handle various browsers and platforms.
