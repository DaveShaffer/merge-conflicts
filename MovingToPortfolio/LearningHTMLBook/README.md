# Sams Teach Yourself HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Second edition

### by Julie C. Meloni

These HTML pages represent my attempt ot learn coding from a book.  I was inspired when I took a Ruby on Rails workshop at General Assembly in December of 2015.  The instructor had shown my classmates and me several websites that taught coding for free, but I like to learn out of a book where I can mark my place with a bookmark and use a highlighter to make the important points easier to locate.  Even though it had been many years since I wrote a program, it began to came back and I realized I could still do it.
